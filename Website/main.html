            What is a Cellular Automaton?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Celllular Automaton is a term used to describe a model consisting of cells that interact with other cells according to a
            pre-determined set of rules. These interactions happen according to a global clock. They tend to be studied in
            Computer Science and Mathematics.
            <br>
            <br> Cellular Automata can be represented in a number of ways, most comonly by a 2D grid where each space in the
            grid represents a "cell" where each cell has a colour in order to represent its state.

            Origins
        </h2>
        <p>
            The concept of Cellular Automata was originally discovered by Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann in the 1940s.
            <br>
            <br> However it wasn't untill the 1970s with the creation of 'Conway's game of life' that interest in the subject
            really took off.
            <br>
            <br> In 'A New Kind of Science', Stephen Wolfram proposed that there are 4 classifications of Cellular Automata:
            <ol>
                <li>Nearly all patters evolve quickly to a stable state.</li>
                <li>Nearly all patters evolve into a stable or oscillating state.</li>
                <li>Nearly all patters evolve into a psuedo-random or chaotic state.</li>
                <li>Nearly all patters evolve into structures that interact in complex and interesting ways.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

            Uses of Cellular Automata
        </h2>
        <p>
            In Computer Processors, A Cellular Automaton processors is a physcial implementation of an automaton that can process infomration.
            These tend to have very specific uses and cannt be used for anything but what they were intended for.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a>Rule 30</a> is a one-dimentional Automaton that was originally suggested as a block cipher for use in criptography
            due to its highly chaotic nature.
            <br>
            <br> Some two-dimentional automata can be used in order to generate psuedo-random numbers.
            <br>
            <br> Cellular Automata have also been proposed as a way of doing public key encryption. As some automata can act
            like one-way functions, such that given the rule it is easy to calculate future states, but not past states.
