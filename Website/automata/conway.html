            Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            Created by John Horton Conway in 1970, Conway's game of Life is a two-dimentional cellular automaton where each cell has
            two states: Alive or Dead. The game istelf exists in an infinite Two-Dimentional grid of square cells.
            <br>
            <br> Although it is a 'game' it is one that requires no player. This means that the outcome of the game is solely
            reliant on the starting conditions. That being which cells are which state when the the atomaton is started.
        </p>

            Rules
        </h2>
        <p>
            Each time step every cell interacts with its 8 neighbours and decides which state to change to depending on the states of
            the surrounding neighbours. At each time increment, there are four events:
            <ol>
                <li>Any living cell with less than two living neighbours dies</li>
                <li>Any living cell with two or three living neighbours lives</li>
                <li>Any livin cell with more than 3 neighbours dies</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with three neigbours becomes alive</li>
            </ol>
            However each cell should be checked simultaniously, meaning that if at time step 4 a cell dies, all other cells will still
            see it as alive until time step 5.

            Patterns
        </h2>
        <p>
            Many different patterns have been observed in Conway's Game of Life, some of which are static, and once reached do not change
            without ouside interference (Called Still Lifes). Others oscillate between multiple states (Oscillators) and
            some move across the grid indefinately (Gliders).
            <br>
            <br> As well as these types there are 'Guns' which are patterns that oscillate and in their oscillation create gliders.
