            Overview

        <p>
            Rule 30 is a one-dimentional Cellular Automaton devised by Stephen Wolfram in 1983. It consists of an infinite one-dimentional
            array of binary elements.
            <br>
            <br> To begin with each cell has a state 0 or 1, then at each time step each cell changes state depending on it's
            own and its two neighbour's states.
            <br>
            <br> The state results are shown below.
            <br>
            <br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Current States</th>
                    <th>111</th>
                    <th>110</th>
                    <th>101</th>
                    <th>100</th>

        <p>
            Rule 30 is easy to visualise in a single picture as it is only one dimentional, meaning its change over time can be shown
            in a still image.
            <br>
            <br> This is an example of a Rule 30 where the initial condition was one cell with the value 1, and the rest being
            0.

            Stephen Wolfram was a British-American computer scientist and physicist who was born in london but spent most of his professional
            career in the Unites States.
            <br>
            <br> When he created the Rule 30 Automaton, Wolfram was working as a researcher at The Institude for Advanced Study
            in Princeton, where he specialised in Cellular Automata.
